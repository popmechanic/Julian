This is the opening paragraph, and it should get a drop cap treatment. The first letter should be large and decorative, setting the tone for the rest of the letter.

The second paragraph flows normally. Here we test **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code` to make sure the renderer handles standard markdown correctly.

After a decorative break, we continue with new thoughts. The break should appear as three dots in the Elektron Pixel font.

> [!insight]
> This is an insight admonition. It should have special styling that distinguishes it from a regular blockquote.

> [!question]
> This is a question admonition. Does the pipeline work end to end?

The letter ends here. If you're reading this rendered in the browser with proper typography, the pipeline works.
